### Contributing:

#### Rules:

1. Biden clips only. 
2. No music in the background. 
3. Don't vandalize. I'm sure this will attract angry liberal Karens.
4. Use clear, coherent clips. I mean, Biden is rarely coherent, but as long as you can understand the words he's saying.

#### How to contribute:

1. Google for a good [YouTube downloader](https://www.google.com/search?q=youtube+downloader), download some clips of Biden saying some ridiculous bullshit, trim them up in your favorite editor and extract the audio.
2. Put your clip in the `./audio` folder and add it to the `./data/clips.json` file.
3. Submit your [pull request](https://yangsu.github.io/pull-request-tutorial/).
4. ...
5. Profit!
